\frametitle{Why is Futhark faster?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Independent (accumulating) for-loop iterations can easily* be rewritten as
    as map/reduce operations.

  \item The Futhark language uses a heavily optimizing compiler, that rewards
    map/reduce patterns with major performance increases.

  \item (In case of basic Python implemented models, it's trivial to make them go
    faster.)
  \end{itemize}

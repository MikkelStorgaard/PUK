\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Goal and motivation}
\textit{SasView} is a Small Angle Scattering (SAS) analysis package for the analysis of
1D and 2D scattering data directly in inverse space.
As \textit{SasView} is given data, it performs its analyses by running the input data
through theory models provided by the standalone module \textit{Sasmodels}.
\\
\\
The \textit{Sasmodels} models utilizes a set of kernels, which are implemented
in both OpenCL and OpenMP.
However, benchmark
comparisons\footnote{https://futhark-lang.org/performance.html} between the
parallel algorithm library \textit{Thrust} (implemented in C++/CUDA), and the
array programming language Futhark, shows that there might severe speed
improvements to gain by running these model calculations in Futhark, instead
of in OpenCL and OpenMP.
\\
\\
The goal of this project is to explore the potential speed gains obtained by
rewriting, and testing the resulting speed improvements of, a subset of the
\textit{Sasmodels} models.
The subset will be chosen so that there are at least
one ``simple'' model, one model of intermediate complexity, and one complex
model in it.
\\
\\
If rewriting the models results in a significant\footnote{I.e. a speed increase
  in order of at least a magnitude}, speedup, it will reasonable to believe that the
rest of the models in \textit{Sasmodels} can be rewritten for a similar speedup.
